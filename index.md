abstract: Seafloor spreading at slow rates can be accommodated on large‐offset oceanic
  detachment faults (ODFs), that exhume lower crustal and mantle rocks in footwall
  domes termed oceanic core complexes (OCCs). Footwall rocks experience large rotation
  during exhumation, yet important aspects of the kinematics—particularly the relative
  roles of solid‐block rotation and flexure—are not clearly understood. Using a high‐resolution
  numerical model, we explore the exhumation kinematics in the footwall beneath an
  emergent ODF/OCC. A key feature of the models is that footwall motion is dominated
  by solid‐block rotation, accommodated by the nonplanar, concave‐down fault interface.
  A consequence is that curvature measured along the ODF is representative of a neutral
  stress configuration, rather than a “bent” one. Instead, it is in the subsequent
  process of “apparent unbending” that significant flexural stresses are developed
  in the model footwall. The brittle strain associated with apparent unbending is
  produced dominantly in extension, beneath the OCC, consistent with earthquake clustering
  observed in the Trans‐Atlantic Geotraverse at the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge.
